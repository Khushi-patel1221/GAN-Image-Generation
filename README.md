This repository contains code for generating images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the CelebA dataset. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, defining the GAN architecture, and training the discriminator and generator models.
Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of GANs to generate realistic images of celebrities. The GAN consists of a generator that creates fake images and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and fake images. The two models are trained together in an adversarial setup.
Dataset
The CelebA dataset is used for training. It contains over 200,000 celebrity images with various attributes. For this project, images are resized to 64x64 pixels.
